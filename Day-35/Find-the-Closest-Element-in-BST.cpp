Problem Statement->

Given a BST and an integer. Find the least absolute difference between any node value of the BST and the given integer.

Example 1:

Input:
        10
      /   \
     2    11
   /  \ 
  1    5
      /  \
     3    6
      \
       4
K = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: K=13. The node that has
value nearest to K is 11. so the answer
is 2
Example 2:

Input:
      8
    /   \
   1     9
    \     \
     4    10
    /
   3
K = 9
Output: 0
Explanation: K=9. The node that has
value nearest to K is 9. so the answer
is 0.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minDiff() that takes the root of the BST and an integer K as its input and returns the minimum absolute difference between any node value of the BST and the integer K.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Height of the BST).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the BST).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 100000

Approach-> If target value K is present in given BST, then itâ€™s the node having minimum absolute difference.
If target value K is less than the value of current node then move to the left child.
If target value K is greater than the value of current node then move to the right child.*/

int minDiff(Node *root, int K)
    {
        //Your code here
        Node *p=root;
      int d=abs(p->data-K);
        while(p)
        {
           if(abs(p->data-K)<d){
            d=abs(p->data-K);}
            
            if(p->data<K)
            {
                p=p->right;
            }else
            {
                p=p->left;
            }
       }return d;
    }
//Time Complexity: O(Height of the BST).
